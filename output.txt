}Here is a simple recipe for a classic homemade pie:

Ingredients:
- 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup butter, chilled and diced
- 1/4 cup ice water

Instructions:
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.
2. Add the diced butter to the flour mixture and use a pastry cutter or fork to cut the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
3. Slowly add the ice water to the flour mixture, stirring until the dough comes together.
4. Form the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
5. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
6. Roll out the chilled dough on a floured surface to fit your pie dish.
7. Place the rolled-out dough in the pie dish and trim any excess overhang.
8. Fill the pie crust with your desired filling (such as fruit filling, custard, or savory filling).
9. If making a double-crust pie, cover the filling with a second layer of rolled-out dough, seal the edges, and cut slits in the top crust for ventilation.
10. Bake the pie in the preheated oven for about 45-50 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.
11. Allow the pie to cool before serving.

Enjoy your delicious homemade pie![
