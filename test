1. Installing and Configuring Nginx:
```
- hosts: web_servers
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
    - name: Copy Nginx configuration file
      template:
        src: /path/to/nginx.conf.j2
        dest: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
      notify:
        - Restart Nginx
    - name: Start Nginx service
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
  handlers:
    - name: Restart Nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: restarted
```

2. Managing Users:
```
- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure user 'johndoe' exists
      user:
        name: johndoe
        state: present
    - name: Ensure 'johndoe' is in 'sudo' group
      user:
        name: johndoe
        groups: sudo
        append: yes
```

3. Deploying a Web Application:
```
- hosts: web_servers
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Clone the Git repository
      git:
        repo: https://github.com/example/myapp.git
        dest: /var/www/myapp
    - name: Install Node.js dependencies
      npm:
        path: /var/www/myapp
    - name: Configure PM2
      command: pm2 start /var/www/myapp/app.js
```

4. Managing Firewall Rules:
```
- hosts: web_servers
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Allow incoming HTTP traffic
      ufw:
        rule: allow
        name: 'HTTP'
    - name: Allow incoming SSH traffic
      ufw:
        rule: allow
        port: '22'
```

5. Taking MySQL Database Backup:
```
- hosts: db_servers
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Perform MySQL backup
      command: mysqldump -u root -p{{ mysql_root_password }} --all-databases > /var/backups/mysql_backup.sql
```

These playbooks are just examples and may need to be customized based on your specific requirements and environment.1. Installing and Configuring Nginx:

Nginx (pronounced "engine x") is a popular open-source web server and reverse proxy server. It is known for its high performance, stability, and scalability. Nginx is commonly used to serve static content, act as a reverse proxy for application servers, and load balance web traffic.

The playbook provided is a configuration management task written in Ansible. It is used to automate the installation and configuration of Nginx on web_servers. The playbook has the following tasks:
1. Install Nginx using the apt module.
2. Copy Nginx configuration file from a Jinja2 template to the destination /etc/nginx/nginx.conf.
3. Start the Nginx service.
4. Define a handler to restart Nginx service when configuration changes.

2. Managing Users:

This playbook is used to manage user accounts on all hosts specified. In this specific example, it ensures the existence of the 'johndoe' user and adds the user to the 'sudo' group with sudo permissions. This is a common task in system administration to create and manage user accounts on servers.

3. Deploying a Web Application:

This playbook is focused on deploying a web application on web_servers. It consists of tasks to:
1. Clone a Git repository containing the web application to a specific directory.
2. Install Node.js dependencies for the web application.
3. Configure PM2 (a process manager for Node.js applications) to start the Node.js application.

This playbook automates the process of deploying a web application on target servers and ensures that the application is running correctly.

4. Managing Firewall Rules:

This playbook is used to manage firewall rules on web_servers. It uses the ufw module to allow incoming HTTP and SSH traffic by adding appropriate rules to the firewall configuration. This ensures that the servers can receive web traffic on port 80 (HTTP) and allow SSH access on port 22.

5. Taking MySQL Database Backup:

This playbook is designed to perform a MySQL database backup on db_servers. It uses the command module to run the mysqldump command, which creates a backup of all databases to a specific file location. This task should be run periodically to ensure data backup and recovery in case of data loss or corruption.

Overall, these playbooks demonstrate how Ansible can be used for automation and configuration management tasks, making it easier to manage systems and services in a consistent and reliable manner.
